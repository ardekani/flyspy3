/*!
This class supports all operation on a single view (file). Including Grabbing frame, writing frame, Silh Detection, Tracking in 2D,etc.
Experiment class will keep a vector<View> member variable to support operation on all views later. Ideally, the programmer using this framework should be
oblivious to presence of this class, and use only Methods of Experiment to perform tasks.
